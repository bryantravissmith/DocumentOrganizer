# Upload Folder

When keys and documents are uploaded to the webapp, they are uploaded this folder.  Keys are uploaded to the key folder as images, and documents are uploaded to the document folder with a unique UUID.   A folder is created using the UUID as a name with each page of the PDF converted to an image and saved in this folder.
